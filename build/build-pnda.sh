# This script builds the packages needed to provision PNDA. These include:
#   PNDA components - source code that is part of PNDA e.g. platform-deployment-manager
#   Upstream projects - source code of projects that PNDA depends on e.g. Kafka Manager
#
# This script supports three use cases:
#
#   Build latest PNDA components & upstream projects to a given branch or tag
#     Pass "BRANCH" as first parameter
#     Pass PNDA branch or tag as the second parameter (e.g. develop)
#     PNDA components are built with the version specifier set to the branch or tag
#
#   Build master PNDA components & upstream projects at release X
#     Pass "RELEASE" as first parameter
#     Pass PNDA release tag as second parameter (e.g. release/3.2)
#     PNDA components are built with the version specifier set to corresponding component release (e.g. 0.1.2)
#
#   Build PNDA components & upstream projects to specific 'BOM'
#     Pass "BOM" as first parameter
#     Pass a file path as the second parameter (e.g. /home/alice/bomfile)
#     The file must contain a list of space delimited component/project version pairs
#
# Please refer to README.md in this directory for more details
#
# Note: this script uses bash 4 features and has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04
