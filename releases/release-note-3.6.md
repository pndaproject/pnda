# PNDA 3.6

PNDA release 3.6 comes with a couple of new features, a number of additions/improvements and various bug fixes.

### Modular PNDA CLI
The PNDA CLI is a new repo that offers an used to execute operational tasks on PNDA clusters.
The vision for this sub-project is that it eventually replaces all the individual 'template' repositories in PNDA with one common code base, presenting the end user with a unified interface to several different 'back ends'.
At present, the PNDA CLI supports two back ends:
- Creating PNDA on AWS using CloudFormation.
- Creating PNDA on an existing server cluster (PNDA can be installed using the PNDA CLI onto pre-existing machines. In this mode the Cloud Formation parts of the pnda-cli are disabled and it runs only the bootstrap and saltstack stages of PNDA creation).

As a consequence, the [pnda-aws-templates](#pnda-aws-templates) has been marked deprecated and will not be supported with this new release.

For more details refer to the [PNDA CLI](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-cli) repo.

### HDP support
Starting with this release, PNDA has been extended with an additional Hadoop distribution: The [Hortonworks HDP](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-center/hdp/) providing a wider choice of feature set, licensing or pricing.
The Hortonworks HDP distribution 100% open source and introduces some alternative technologies including:
 - Ambari for cluster monitoring, management, [additional UIs](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.5.1.0/bk_ambari-views/content/ch_understanding_ambari_views.html) and [setup](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Blueprints).
 - Hive for MPP SQL queries instead of Impala.

For more details refer to the [Hadoop Distributions](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-guide/blob/develop/gettingstarted/hadoop_distro.md) guide.

### Notable additions or improvements include:
- support for CentOS as an alternative Linux distribution.
- support for creating the mirror and building pnda components from behind a non-transparent proxy.
- support for adding pyspark application dependencies
- addition of Kafkat as option for Kafka management.
- addition of developer and production users as default users of the platform.
- addition of OpenTSDB component in the PNDA console.
- addition of a new 'production' flavor (designed for larger, bare metal clusters).
- upgrade of Kafka(0.11), Logstash(5.2) and CDH(5.12).
